# MicroProfile Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the use of MicroProfile technologies for implementing a set of Microservices.  The tutorial is made up of a number of Open Liberty Guides each of which demonstrates different MicroProfile technologies. Each Guide is designed to be taken independently so if you just want to learn about a specific technology you can just take that guide.  If, however, you're goal is to learn about all the MicroProfile capabilities, then working through them in the order shown below is recommended.
