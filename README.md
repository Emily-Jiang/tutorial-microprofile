# MicroProfile Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the use of MicroProfile technologies for implementing a set of Microservices. The tutorial is 
made up of a number of Open Liberty Guides each of which demonstrates different MicroProfile technologies. Each Guide is 
designed to be taken independently so if you just want to learn about a specific technology you can just take that guide.  
If, however, you're goal is to learn about all the MicroProfile capabilities, then working through them in the order shown 
below is recommended.


### Creating a RESTful web service

Learn how to create a REST service with JAX-RS, JSON-P, and Open Liberty that will expose the JVM’s system properties.

### Injecting dependencies into microservices    

Learn how to use Contexts and Dependency Injection to manage and inject dependencies into RESTful web services.

### Building fault-tolerant microservices with the @Fallback annotation

Learn how to use the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification to enable applications to function even when one
of the microservices is unavailable.
